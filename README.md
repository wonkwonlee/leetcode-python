# LeetCode algorithm 

Studying LeetCode problems with Python

Since 2021.03.20

Try to use *Pythonic* approaches.

Although I have studied algorithms and data structure during my undergraduate, I realize I have rather shallow experience in Python. 

This project is to familiarize myself with fundamentals of algorithms and data structure and further to prepare the coding interview.
